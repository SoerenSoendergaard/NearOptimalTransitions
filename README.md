# NearOptimalTransitions
A repository of scripts used in my pre masters thesis containing:

Myopic_Nuclear: A series of greenfield analysis. Also has a swithch for myopic-greenfield.

NearOptimal_Nuclear: Uses the greenfield analysis results, to compute a near optimal solution space for each greenfield analysis.

MultipleSlack: Computes the near optimal solution space at multiple slacks, creating cost contures.

ProcessNearOpt_Nuclear: Plots the results of "NearOptimal_Nuclear"

PlotMultiSlack: Plots the results of "MultipleSlack"
